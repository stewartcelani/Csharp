### [Clean Coding Principles](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/csharp-clean-coding-principles) by Cory House

Clean code is the art of writing code that humans can understand. In this course, Clean Coding Principles in C#, you'll elevate your professionalism and increase your C# code quality by writing with the reader in mind. This course is built upon three core clean coding practices: selecting the right tool for the job, optimizing the signal to noise ratio, and creating self-documenting logic. Throughout this course you'll see clear comparisons between "dirty" C# code to avoid and the "clean" equivalent. You'll explore patterns like arrow code, failing fast, returning early, magnet classes, mayfly variables, techniques for reducing method complexity, and much more. These practices are the foundation for a professional development career and provide developers a clear vocabulary for evaluating code quality.
