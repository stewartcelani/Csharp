### Refactoring Agenda

1. Remove unhelpful comments
2. Refactor to Mayfly variables (move them as close to their first use as possible)
3. Use positive conditionals
4. Implement guard clauses
5. Improve naming
6. Return early
7. Aggregate related logic
8. Consolidate guard clauses
9. Use table-driven method (to avoid hardcoding logic likely to change)
10. Fail fast
